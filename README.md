# 🤖 Predicting Social Media Purchase Intent Using SVM & k-NN from Scratch

This project aims to predict **user purchase intent** from social media behavior using two classic machine learning algorithms: **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** and **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)** — implemented entirely from scratch. The goal is to deepen the understanding of ML fundamentals and apply them to a real-world e-commerce-related problem.

## 🎯 Project Objective

To build custom SVM and k-NN classifiers that accurately predict whether a user will make a purchase based on their social media engagement metrics such as click-through rate, time spent, interactions, and demographics.

## ❓ Why From Scratch?

Most ML frameworks (like scikit-learn) abstract away the inner workings of algorithms.  
**Implementing models from scratch** allows us to:

- Understand the **mathematics and logic** behind each step  
- Control each component of the learning process  
- Learn how to **optimize performance manually**  
- Build a foundation for customizing models in future research or production systems  

This project bridges the gap between theory and practical implementation.

## 📊 Dataset Features

Key input features may include:

- Age, Gender, Device Type  
- Time spent on ads  
- Number of clicks/interactions  
- Engagement with product categories  
- Session duration

**Target Output**:  
- `1` – User is likely to purchase  
- `0` – User is unlikely to purchase
